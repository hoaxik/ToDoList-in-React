# ToDoList-in-React

My first actual project in React using plain JS

# Setup 
**First Step**
Open terminal inside folder of this project and run command
```npm i```

**Second Step**
Run this command after all dependencies are installed
```npm run dev```

Now you can open this project in your browser (the link will be printed in the terminal)
